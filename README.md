# crookse/tmux-theme

These are my configurations for my tmux theme. Take a look at the snapshot below for a visual.

If you're using iTerm2 and want your tmux session names to show up on your iTerm2's tabs, then look at lines 55-64 in the `theme.sh` file. I hated seeing "Thanks for flying Vim" all of the time in my iTerm2 tab titles and decided to do some research (after months of using Vim and tmux) and finally make iTerm2's tab titles reflect the work I'm currently doing in a particular tab.
